# Website Tab Counter

Website Tab Counter is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension that helps you stay organized by tracking how many tabs of a particular website are currently open â€” even across multiple windows.

Whether you're juggling multiple Gmail inboxes, research articles, or work dashboards, this extension keeps count and shows it directly in the tab title, so you never lose track of duplicate or extra tabs.
